Question 7.

https://nrvs.info/faqs/can-vaccines-cause-or-spread-diseases/

A hot topic these days in the medical field concerns vaccinations and whether they are
actually helping us or hurting us. A lot of speculation has risen about whether the
increasing rate of autism is related to vaccinations. It is the opinion of most researchers that although both are increasing, they are not correlated. The article above explores whether other diseases beside autism can be spread or transmitted by vaccinations for that disease. Some of the vaccines explored are the Mumps, Rubella, Varicella, Rotavirus, and Influenza nasal spray. While there are some cases of these vaccinations transmitting disease, they are few and far between. I believe that vaccinations are indeed helpful, and just like with anything else can have some rare cases of harm.

Question 8.

This article damages public opinion and public medicine because it will cause people to stop vaccinating themselves as well as their families. By doing this, they will put others at risk as well having not been vaccinated. Public medicine researchers need to find a way to completely validate and show that vaccinations are not harmful and are an extremely important tool to prevent disease outbreak.

The first step in halting this theory not found to be true is to ensure that all data pushed out is one hundred percent accurate. Academic research groups and organizations need to reanalyze their data process so that research data is looked over by more people and in a more efficient way. By having more researchers and medical professionals examine and validate data about vaccinations and their relation to disease transmission, the public can feel confident knowing that the information they are receiving is accurate.

The researcher of this article took the correct first step in retracting this particular paper, however more could be done to ensure the public realizes it was incorrect. I think to make certain of this, the author should've made a statement renouncing the article and encouraged citizens to go get vaccinated. This would go a long way making people feel safe getting vaccinations again.

These two data sets show the global profile and American profile from the World Health Organization. They could potentially be used in a project or report on vaccination data.

Question 10.

The speakers talked about stories of morning sickness and how that is also a misconstrued topic in the medical field. Data has come out that coffee and other caffeinated drinks can be harmful during a pregnancy as well as morning sickness. They spoke about how this is misleading because they have seen many cases where morning sickness actually helps a pregnancy because it makes the mother not want to eat for most of or the rest of the day. This prevents mothers from taking in any caffeine which does cause complications. They pointed out how you cannot just assume a piece of data is correct and that this is one of the biggest things to be careful of in data analytics of any kind. Overall, I thought the speakers did a great job, especially in giving us some real world examples of false data being spread or any other occurrences that happen during their everyday jobs.
